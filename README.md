Several examples of testing with Spring Boot.

## Overview of Projects
Each folder groups a single example as follows:

- [_rest_](./rest/) shows the foundation of a REST unit test.
- [_reactive testing_](https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/reactivity-examples/tree/testing) shows how to test the entire stack of a reactive Web application with Spring Boot (_another repo_). 
- [_testing-contract_](https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/reactivity-examples/tree/testing-contract) shows how to use consumer-driven contract testing to ensure that client/service (consumer/provider) agrees with a common interface (_another repo_).
